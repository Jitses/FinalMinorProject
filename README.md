# MinorProject
Final project of the Minor Programmeren at the University of Amsterdam

Idea:
Second world war, timelapse of countries that were conquered and freed, by dynamic colour filling.
Focus will be on Europe. Since WWII was such an important event, it is beneficial for general knowledge to see how the war evolved over time. The target audience are historians, the regular public and schools could also use the visualisation for teaching about WWII

If there is time left in the end, Japan and Africa will also be looked at.

Graphs:
Sunburst graph can be used to show number of casualties per nationality and zoom in how many of those casualities were lost per important battle.

Hover drop down menu with important battles, information about the battle. Number of casualties per battle in bar chart. On x axis countries and on y axis number of casualties.

General information about countries when hovering over the country: leader, number of inhabitants, free or conquered in the war.

Buttons:
German territory expansion: on click, shows the german territory expansion in colour per month
Allied territory takeback: on click, shows the allied territory take back in colour per month

Timeline: can be dragged to show the German occupation and freed countries by colour on monthly basis.
