Map of Europe:

- Play button. Onclick it shows the growth of the nazi empire over time and the takeback by the allied forces. The timeline     moves along with the time.
- On hover over country:
  Tooltip with leader country, casualties at end of war, size army.
- Under the map a timeline from 1939 (start of war, invasion of Poland) until 1945. 

Next to the map a bar chart of the number of casualties per important battle. Onclick of a bar, information about that battle occurs from the top left corner with a slide window. The bar chart starts with all the battles. When the play button is clicked, the bar chart becomes empty and starts to fill itself with bars of the battles when they have occured according to the timeline.

Under the map, a scroll down arrow:
onclick: page scrolls down
New section shows sunburst diagram:
  - nr. of casualties
      - per nationality
          - per battle
 
Optional: 
- button of allied takeback and button of german empire expansion. So separate timeframes instead of a single play button.
- Include other continents
