- Made a bar chart, works fine with every country's data, which was already jsonified
- Made a map of Europe
- Made a dragable bar that changes the colour of all countries on the map

# 8-6-2018
- Presented my prototype today
- Discussed the problem that when a country is partly occupied, how I will show this on the map.
  Solution: another colour or stripes in country than when it is fully taken over by the Germans.
- Worked on the linked interaction between my map and bar chart. Does not work optimally yet.
